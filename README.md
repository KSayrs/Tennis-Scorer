# Tennis-Scorer
An Android App that keeps track of scoring in a basic tennis game. Will also take into account Deuces, and will mention with player has the advantage.
There is no hard limit on matches. The scores will not completely reset unless the user presses the "Reset" button.
This app also supports the French language.

## Usage
When a player scores, hit the "Score" button on their side. Press "Reset" to set everything back to zero or love.

## Potential Future Changes
 - Create multiple game "modes" (For things like Tournament Rules)
 - Add more interesting graphics
 - Add more language support
 - Intert names for the players (Instead of just having "Player 1" and "Player 2")
 - Brackets
 - Adjust for side switching
